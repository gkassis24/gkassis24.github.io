Particularly, I led an independent research project where I constructed computational models of certain gene regulatory networks in B cells and investigated their response at the single-cell level in disease and health. This work entailed sourcing network topologies from scientific databases, procuring gene annotations via the Ensembl genome database project\'s Perl API, and utilizing R and Python to process intricate single-cell RNA expression datasets. Employing techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering methods such as K-means, t-SNE, and UMAP, I studied gene expression patterns. I also used a genetic algorithm to simulate immune cell activation in various patient conditions including HIV, breast cancer, lung cancer, and COVID-19. Moreover, to validate the significance of my findings, I employed statistical tests such as Chi-squared, t-test, and ANOVA. My engagement extended beyond research as I actively participated in weekly lab meetings, where I honed my skills in analyzing scientific literature, exchanged research progress updates, and incorporated insights from fellow lab members\' projects.',

This award recognizes excellence in research, poster design, and presentation - elements that I continuously worked on enhancing during my time at the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. The award is a nod to the findings I uncovered while studying gene regulatory networks in B cells across a variety of medical conditions. It was a privilege to share my discoveries at the program’s research exposition through a poster that aimed to blend science and design. This recognition serves as a reminder of the supportive environment that encouraged my research endeavors and growth.',

Freedman and a Ph.D. mentor, I engaged in hands-on research focused on identifying how the brain allocates cognitive resources and on finding biomarkers for Parkinson’s disease and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This experience encompassed a range of responsibilities, from meticulously preparing research sessions – involving the setup and synchronization of EEG equipment, OptiTrack motion capture systems, and a Pupil Labs eye tracker – to prepping participants for experiments by applying conductive gel, placing EEG electrodes, and arranging motion capture markers. Vigilantly monitoring EEG signals, I also swiftly addressed technical challenges to maintain data quality throughout the experiments\' sessions. My role at the lab extended beyond data collection as I also performed data archiving and data analysis using MATLAB, Python, and C++. Equipped with a variety of computational skills, I set forth to independently integrate a wearable eye tracker into the lab and trained several classifiers including random forests, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks to optimize the detection of different types of eye movements recorded.  In addition, I wrote a coding pipeline that used this eye tracker and independent component analysis to accurately filter out eye movements and muscle contractions artifacts from EEG recordings. On a weekly basis, I participated in a journal club where I actively contributed to the lab\'s academic discourse as we critically evaluated recent scientific literature.',
